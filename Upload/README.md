This folder should be used to keep any staged runs on the Turbo drive that are ready to be uploaded to the Data Den archive. Staged runs (a single tar archive) should be uploaded to the Data Den archive manually using the Globus service.

This file will be pushed to GitHub so this folder is created every time the repository is cloned.
All other files/folders in this path will be ignored for version control.
